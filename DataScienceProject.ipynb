For each dataset you should generate at least one question you hope to answer with that data as well as a small amount of ETL including 3-5 interesting stats and one graph. This is just an outline to make sure you are thinking and is not a commitment in any way. This will be published on your GitHub IO page so this also makes sure you’ve figured out how to get it uploaded!\n",

Examples include: we setup a private Github repo to coordinate code and we met on Zoom X times…. or even we used LiveShare for CS Code Teletype for Atom or RemoteCollab for Sublime. Failure to turn in a collaboration plan that shows you coordinated will be a loss of professionalism points. The turned in result will need to reflect the understanding of both students\n",

You should clearly discuss the data and what challenges you had in formatting it.\n",
