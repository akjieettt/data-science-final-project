        "## Project Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Our project will investigate the relationship between chemical composition and wine quality, focusing on identifying which physicochemical properties most strongly predict wine quality and how these relationships differ between red and white wines. Our project aims to provide insights into wine production that could benefit winemakers and consumers. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Research Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "**Primary Question**: *What chemical properties most strongly predict wine quality?*\n",
        "\n",
        "**Secondary Question**: *How do chemical compositions differ between red and white wines, and what are the optimal chemical ranges for high-quality wines?*\n",
        "\n",
        "### Background\n",
        "\n",
        "Wine quality assessment is traditionally based on expert sensory evaluation, but understanding the underlying chemical composition can provide objective insights into what makes a wine exceptional. The wine industry relies on physicochemical properties to guide production decisions and quality control.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine region produces both red and white wines with distinct characteristics. Wine quality is rated on a scale from 0-10 based on sensory data from expert evaluations, considering factors like aroma, taste, and overall balance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Motivation For This Project\n",
        "\n",
        "Wine production is an art and science where chemical composition determines quality. Understanding these relationships through data science can provide valuable insights for:\n",
        "- **Winemakers**: Optimizing production processes and chemical formulations\n",
        "- **Consumers**: Making informed purchasing decisions\n",
        "- **Industry**: Quality control and standardization\n",
        "\n",
        "Key factors we're investigating:\n",
        "- **Chemical Balance**: How different acidity components interact\n",
        "- **Wine Type Differences**: Red vs white wine chemical requirements\n",
        "- **Quality Predictors**: Which properties matter most for high ratings\n",
        "\n",
        "### Collaboration Plan\n",
        "\n",
        "**Team Coordination:**\n",
        "- Set up a private GitHub repository to coordinate all code, share datasets, and track progress\n",
        "- Each member works on separate branches to implement features, which are merged via pull requests after code review to ensure consistency\n",
        "\n",
        "**Technologies Used:**\n",
        "- Version Control: Git and GitHub for source code management and collaboration\n",
        "- Development Environment: Visual Studio Code Live Share, Google Colab, and Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and prototyping\n",
        "- Communication Tools: Small Family Collaboration Hub for offline discussions, FaceTime for online discussions and Google Docs for shared notes\n",
        "\n",
        "**Meeting Schedule:**\n",
        "- Consistently meet offline 2 - 3 times per week for 1 - 3 hours per session to discuss progress, solve problems, and coordinate tasks\n",
        "- Outside of scheduled meetings, we communicate asynchronously via iMessage to stay aligned and share updates\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task Management:**\n",
        "- Tasks are divided based on expertise and interest\n",
        "- Progress is tracked via a shared progress table (in a spreadsheet) to ensure deadlines are met and responsibilities are clear"
